# Cloudflare Configuration
# IMPORTANT: This Express.js app CANNOT run on Cloudflare Workers
# 
# This file is created to prevent build errors, but you should:
# 1. Deploy to Railway/Fly.io instead (RECOMMENDED)
# 2. OR use Cloudflare Pages for frontend only (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
#
# To fix the build error, change your deploy command from:
#   npx wrangler deploy
# To:
#   npm start  (for Railway/Fly.io/Render)
# OR
#   npx wrangler pages deploy ./public  (for Cloudflare Pages frontend only)

# This is a placeholder - Express.js apps don't work on Workers
# Deploy to Railway/Fly.io/Render instead, then use Cloudflare as CDN/proxy
